  [tkimnguyen]


1.8.4 (2018-04-24)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Call ``processForm`` with ``{None: None}`` dict as values.
  This prevents ``processForm`` using ``REQUEST.form`` and overwriting
  values already set by ``invokeFactory``.
  Fixes `issue 99 <https://github.com/plone/plone.api/issues/99>`_.
  [david-batranu]

- Simplification/minor speedup:
  Permissions checks now directly use AccessControl.
  Technical its now exact the same as before.
  Before a tool lookup was needed, calling a utility function, calling AccessControl.

------------------

Bug fixes:

- Improved code quality according to isort and flake8.  [maurits]

1.8.1 (2017-10-17)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Don't rename an object when the id already is the target id.
  Fixes `issue 361 <https://github.com/plone/plone.api/issues/361>`_.
  [jaroel]

- Change content.delete to allow both obj=None and objects=[] or objects=None.
  Fixes `issue 383 <https://github.com/plone/plone.api/issues/383>`_.
  [jaroel]

- Let ``zope.i18n`` do the language negotiation for our ``translate`` function.
  Our ``get_current_translation`` does not always give the correct one, especially with combined languages:
  ``nl-be`` (Belgian/Flemish) should fall back to ``nl`` (Dutch).
  The correct negotiated language can also differ per translation domain, which we do not account for.
  ``zope.i18n`` does that better.
  Fixes `issue 379 <https://github.com/plone/plone.api/issues/379>`_.
  [maurits]

  [flohcim]

  [winstonf88]

- Amend user.get method to accept a userid parameter, refs #112.
  [cewing, xiru, winstonf88]

  .. note::
    This change fixes a bug in the earlier implementation that could cause
    errors in some situations. This situation will only arise if the userid and
    username for a user are not the same. If membrane is being used for content-
    based user objects, or if email-as-login is enabled *and* a user has changed
    their email address this will be the case. In the previous implementation
    the username parameter was implicitly being treated as userid. The new
    implementation does not do so. If consumer code is relying on this bug and
    passing userid, and if that code uses the username parameter as a keyword
    parameter, then lookup will fail. In all other cases, there should be no
    difference.

- Fix api.content copy/move/rename functions to return the object after they
  change content, refs #115.
  [rodfersou]

- Make Travis IRC notification message to be one-line instead of three-lines.
  [zupo]

  on how to write good docstrings.
  [zupo]
