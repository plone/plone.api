  reduces the number of builds but keeps basically the same coverage.
  [hvelarde]

  jobs.
  [hvelarde]

1.0.0-rc.2 (2013-10-09)
-----------------------

- Proof-read the docs, improved grammar and wording.
  [cewing]

- Add plone.recipe.codeanalysis to our buildout.
  [flohcim]

- Make all assertRaise() calls use the `with` keyword.
  [winstonf88]

- Amend user.get method to accept a userid parameter, refs #112.
  [cewing, xiru, winstonf88]

  .. note::
    This change fixes a bug in the earlier implementation that could cause
    errors in some situations. This situation will only arise if the userid and
    username for a user are not the same. If membrane is being used for content-
    based user objects, or if email-as-login is enabled *and* a user has changed
    their email address this will be the case. In the previous implementation
    the username parameter was implicitly being treated as userid. The new
    implementation does not do so. If consumer code is relying on this bug and
    passing userid, and if that code uses the username parameter as a keyword
    parameter, then lookup will fail. In all other cases, there should be no
    difference.

- Add api.env.debug_mode() and api.env.test_mode(), refs #125.
  [sdelcourt]

- Move most of text from docs/index.rst to README.rst so its also visible on
  PyPI and GitHub.
  [zupo]

- Deprecate plone.api on ReadTheDocs and redirect to api.plone.org, refs #130.
  [wormj, zupo]

- Add a new `make coverage` command and add support for posting coverage to
  Coveralls.io.
  [zupo]

- Make api.content.create() also print out the underlying error, refs #118.

- Fix api.content copy/move/rename functions to return the object after they
  change content, refs #115.
  [rodfersou]

- Make Travis IRC notification message to be one-line instead of three-lines.
  [zupo]

- More examples of good and bad code blocks in documentation, more information
