plone.api
=========

.. topic:: Overview

    The ``plone.api`` is an elegant and simple API, built for humans wishing
    to develop with Plone.

    It comes with *cookbook*-like documentation and step-by-step instructions
    for doing common development tasks in Plone. Recipes try to assume the user
    does not have extensive knowledge about Plone internals.

The intention of this package is to be transitional. It points out the parts of
Plone which are particularly nasty -- we hope they will get fixed so that we
can deprecate the ``plone.api`` methods that cover them up, but the
documentation can still be useful.

Some parts of the documentation already are this way: they don't use
``plone.api`` methods directly, but simply provide guidance on achieving a task
using Plone's internals. Example: usage of the catalog in `Find content`
example.

The intention is to cover 20% of the tasks we do 80% of the time. Keeping
everything in one place helps keep the API introspectable and discoverable,
which are important aspects of being Pythonic.

.. note::

    This package is still under development, but should be fairly stable and is
    already being used in production. It's currently a release candidate,
    meaning that we don't intend to change method signatures, but it may still
    happen.
