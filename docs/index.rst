*******************************
A Plone API
*******************************

.. topic:: Overview

    The :mod:`plone.api` is an elegant and simple API, built for humans wishing
    to develop with Plone.

    It comes with *cookbook*-like documentation with step-by-step instructions
    for doing common development tasks in Plone. Recipes try to assume the user
    does not have extensive knowledge about Plone internals.

The intention of this package is to be transitional. It points out which parts
of Plone are particularly nasty -- we wish they get fixed so we can deprecate
*plone.api* methods that cover them up, but leave the documentation in place.

Some parts of documentation already are this way: they don't use *plone.api*
methods directly, but simply provide guidance on achiving a task using Plone's
internals. Example: usage of the catalog in :ref:`content_find_example`.

The intention is to cover 20% of tasks we do 80% of the time. Keeping everything
in one place helps keep the API introspectable and discoverable, which are
important aspects of being Pythonic.

.. warning::

    This package is still under heavy development. Do not use it yet unless you
    are completely sure what you are doing.
