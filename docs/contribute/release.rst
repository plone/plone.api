Releasing a new version
=======================

Releasing a new version of `plone.api` involves the following steps:

#. Prepare source for a new release.
#. Create a git tag for the release.
#. Push the git tag upstream to GitHub.
#. Generate a distribution file for the package.
#. Upload the generated package to Python Package Index (PyPI).
#. Tell ReadTheDocs to display the latest version of docs by default.

To avoid human errors and to automate some of the tasks above we use
``jarn.mkrelease``. It's listed as a dependency in ``setup.py`` and should
already be installed in your local bin:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ bin/mkrelease --help

Apart from that, in order to be able to upload a new version to PyPI you need to
be listed under `Package Index Owner` list and you need to configure your PyPI
credentials in the ``~/.pypirc`` file, e.g.::

    [distutils]
    index-servers =
      pypi

    [pypi]
    username = fred
    password = secret


Checklist
=========

Folow these step to create a new release of `plone.api`.

#. Verify that we have documented all changes in the ``CHANGES.rst`` file. Go
   through the list of commits since last release on GitHub and check all
   changes are documented.

#. Modify the version identifier in the ``setup.py`` to reflect the version of
   the new release.

#. Confirm that the package description (generated from ``README.rst`` and
   others) renders correctly by running ``bin/longtest`` and open its ouput in
   your favorite browser.

#. Commit all changes to the git repository and push them upstream to GitHub.

#. Create a release, tag it in git and upload it to GitHub by running
   ``bin/mkrelease -d pypi -pq .`` (see example below).

#. Go to ``https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/ploneapi/versions/`` and choose
   the latest version to be displayed as the default version.


Example
=======

In the following example we are releasing version 0.1 of `plone.api`. The
package has been prepared so that ``version.txt`` contains the version ``0.1``,
this change has been committed to git and all changes have been pushed
upstream to GitHub:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  # Check that package description is rendered correctly
  $ bin/longtest

  # Make a release and upload it to PyPI
  $ bin/mkrelease -d pypi -pq ./
  Releasing plone.api 0.1
  Tagging plone.api 0.1
  To git@github.com:plone/plone.api.git
  * [new tag]         0.1 -> 0.1
  running egg_info
  running sdist

  done

.. note::
  Please ignore the sdist warning about README file above. PyPI does not depend
  on it and it's just a bug in setupools (reported and waiting to be fixed).
