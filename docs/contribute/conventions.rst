    WARNING: If you are reading this on GitHub, DON'T! Read it on ReadTheDocs:
    http://ploneapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contribute/conventions.html so you
    have working references and proper formatting.

.. _conventions:

===========
Conventions
===========

Line length
===========

All Python code in this package should be PEP8 valid. However, we don't strictly
enforce the 80-char line length rule. It is encouraged to have your code
formatted in 80-char lines, but somewhere it's just more readable to break this
rule for a few characters. Long and descriptive test method names are a good
example of this.

.. note::
    Configuring your editor to display a line at 80th column helps a lot
    here and saves time.

.. note::
    The line length rules also applies to non-python source files, such as
    documentation .rst files.


Docstrings style
================

Read and follow http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/. That's it.


About imports
=============

1. Don't use * to import `everything` from a module, because if you do,
   pyflakes cannot detect undefined names (W404).
2. Don't use commas to import multiple stuff on a single line. Some developers
   use IDEs (like `Eclipse <http://pydev.org/>_) or tools (such as `mr.igor
   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.igor>`_) that expect one import per line.
   Let's be nice to them.
3. Don't use relative paths, again to be nice to people using certain IDEs and
   tools. Also `Google Python Style Guide` recommends against it.

.. sourcecode:: python

    from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    from zope.component import getSiteManager

instead of

.. sourcecode:: python

    from plone.app.testing import *
    from zope.component import getMultiAdapter, getSiteManager
    from .portal import get


Grouping and sorting
--------------------

Imports should be grouped according to the
`PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>`_ and `rope
<http://rope.sourceforge.net/overview.html#sorting-imports>`_ conventions::

    [__future__ imports]
    from __future__ import division

    [standard imports]
    import random

    [third-party imports]
    from Acquisition import aq_inner
    from Products.CMFCore.interfaces import ISiteRoot
    from Products.CMFCore.WorkflowCore import WorkflowException

    [package imports]
    from plone.api import portal
    from plone.api.exc import MissingParameterError

Inside each group, lines should be alphabetically sorted.


.. _changelog:

Changelog
=========

Feature-level changes to code are tracked inside ``docs/HISTORY.txt``. Examples:

- added feature X
- removed Y
- fixed bug Z

Add an entry every time you add/remove a feature, fix a bug, etc.


.. _sphinx-docs:

Sphinx Documentation
====================

Un-documented code is broken code.

For every feature you add to the codebase you should also add documentation
for it to ``docs/``.

After adding/modifying documentation, run ``make`` to re-generate your docs.

Also, documentation is automatically generated from these source files every
time code is pushed to `master` branch on GitHub. The post-commit hook is
handled by ReadTheDocs and the results (nice HTML pages) are visible at
http://ploneapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.


.. _travis_ci:

Travis Continuous Integration
=============================

On every push to GitHub, `Travis <http://travis-ci.org/plone/plone.api>`_
runs all tests and syntax validation checks and reports build outcome to
``TODO: which?`` mailinglist and to the ``#sprint`` IRC channel.

Travis is configured with the ``.travis.yml`` file located in the root of this
package.


.. _git_workflow:

Git workflow & branching model
==============================

Our repository on GitHub has the following layout:

* **feature branches**: all development for new features must be done in
  dedicated branches, normaly one branch per feature,
* **master branch**: when features get completed they are merged into the maste
  branch; bugfixes are commited directly on the master branch,
* **tags**: whenever we create a new release we tag the repository so we can
  later re-trace our steps, re-release versions, etc.


.. _setting_up_git:

Setting up Git
==============

Git is a very useful tool, especially when you configure it to your needs. Here
are a couple of tips.

Enhanced git prompt
-------------------

Do one (or more) of the following:

* http://clalance.blogspot.com/2011/10/git-bash-prompts-and-tab-completion.html
* http://en.newinstance.it/2010/05/23/git-autocompletion-and-enhanced-bash-prompt/
* http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/05/bash-auto-completion.html


Example of ``~/.gitconfig``
---------------------------

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [user]
        name = John Smith
        email = john.smith@gmail.com
    [diff "cfg"]
        funcname = ^\\(\\[.*\\].*\\)$
    [color]
        diff = auto
        status = auto
        branch = auto
    [alias]
        st = status
        ci = commit
        br = branch
        co = checkout
    [core]
        excludesfile = /home/jsmith/.gitignore
        editor = nano
    [github]
        user = jsmith
        token = <token_here>

Example of ``~/.gitignore``
---------------------------

.. sourcecode:: ini
